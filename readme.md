#PyHooked: a pure Python hotkey module[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/IronManMark20/pyhooked](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/IronManMark20/pyhooked?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)####About - PyHooked is a pure python keyboard hotkey that allows the creation of hotkeys in all Python implementations that support ctypes. Instead of messing around with low level Windows calls, just tell Hooked what your hotkey is and what function you want to call.PyHooked supports IronPython (2.7), PyPy (newest repo version) and CPython (Tested:2.7,3.4,3.5 Most are likely to work) currently. It is pure Python, so porting should be very simple (see The Future below).####Usage - Please see [example.py](https://github.com/ethanhs/pyhooked/blob/master/example.py) for a basic example.I you are using it with a UI library, please see [example_gui.py](https://github.com/ethanhs/pyhooked/blob/master/example_gui.py)Please note that the wiki is out of date, and needs to be updated.####InstallingJust run `$ pip install git+https://github.com/ethanhs/pyhooked.git`####Alternatives -[pyHook](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/) and [pyhk](https://github.com/schurpf/pyhk) inspired the creation of this project. They are great hotkey modules too!####License - PyHooked  Copyright (C) 2015  Ethan SmithThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute itunder certain conditions;PyHooked is licensed under the LGPL v3, or at your choice, any later version.
